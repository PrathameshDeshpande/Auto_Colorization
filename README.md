#### ➤ Colorization is a machine learning model released in March of 2016 that takes a black and white image as input and outputs a colorized version of it. The machine learning model performs colorization based on these semantic meanings, such as grass is green, the sky is blue, and ladybugs are red.
#### ➤ we can use Auto-encoder for the reconstruction of the image, in other words, we would say that it has the ability to generate and that’s exactly what we want to do, we want to generate the three channels of RGB.

#### ➤ Improvement for this model is being made with the use of generative adversarial networks which will be coming shortly.
